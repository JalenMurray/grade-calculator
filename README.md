Still WIP

# TODO:

## For Production

- [x] Allow for weight locking on assignment types. This would allow a user to lock individual assignment weights which would cause the weights for the assignments to automatically set based on the assignment types total weight. If this is unlocked then the assignment type weight shown will just be the sum of all assignment weights and weights will have to be manually entered for each assignment
- [x] Add functionality for Creating new assignment types
- [ ] Add warning at top of page and possibly to API.
- [x] Add functionality for Logging in and authentication for that.
- [x] Add functionality for a Class List dashboard
- [x] Allow Creating new classes
- [x] Allow Possibly Guest Classes
- [x] Desired Grade
